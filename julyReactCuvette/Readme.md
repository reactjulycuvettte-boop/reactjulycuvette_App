<!-- React Intro and Setup -->

1. NPM - Node Package Manager. (App Store/Play Store)
==> Registry - Massive Online Database - Reusable JavaScript Code. - Libraries/Package.
==> Command Line Tool - install, uninstall, manage, update.

2. Setting up Node Project.
==> Install Node js.


3. Package.json
4. Installing and Updating Packages.
5. What is React JS??
==> JavaScript Library.
==> Component Based.
==> HTML + CSS + JS ==> JSX in a single resuable Component.
==> ???? Virtual DOM. // Super Important.
==> Single Page Application.

6. Why React?
==> Reusability.
==> Performance ==> Virtual DOM.
==> Great Developer Experience.
==> Huge Ecosystem & Community.
==> Learn Once, Write Anywhere. 

7. CRA - Create-React-App?
8. Alternative Tool - Vite?



JS Programming Lang => Program => Statements => Variables/Keywords/Datatypes/Function.
JS Programming Lang => Module => Packages => Libraries/Framework.

<!-- React Basics -->

1. What are Components?
2. => Functional and Class Based Components.
   => React Fragments.
3. React is a Declarative Way.
=> Imperative is JavaScript and whereas react is Decalarative.
4. Creating a New React Project?
5. Folder and File Structure of the React Application.
6. ==> Single Page Application.
7. ==> Virtual DOM - A Virtual DOM is a JavaScript-based, in-memory representation of the user interface's Document Object Model (DOM). Modern frameworks like React use the Virtual DOM to improve UI rendering performance by creating a "virtual" copy of the real DOM. When a component's state changes, the framework creates a new Virtual DOM, compares it to the previous one (a process called diffing), and then updates only the changed parts of the actual browser DOM, rather than repainting the entire page.
8. Introduction to JSX Syntax.
=> javascript syntax extension.
1.  How the React Works?
2.  Building a First Custom React Functional Component.
3.  Adding CSS Styles.
4.  Dynamics Data in Component.
5.  Properties (Props) - Parent to Child - Transfer of Data.
6.  Children Props - Concept of Composition.

<!-- React State and Events -->

1.  React State and Events.
====> State is any data that changes over the time.
====> Context of React => Temporary Memory of Components.
====> Events - Actions triggered for performing something.
====> State => x = 10 ==> Clicked Button ==> x + 1 ==> x = 11 => React re-renders the component to reflect the new data on the screen.
2.  Component Functions Execution Understanding.
3.  What are Hooks?
4.  The State Hook - useState.
5.  Working with Multiple States.
6.  Advanced State and Communication.
7.  Lifting the State up.
8.  Child to Parent Communication.
9.  Stateful Components.
10. Stateless Components.

<!-- React Events and Form -->

1. Revision.
2. Updating State that depends on the previous state.
3. Lifting the State up.
4. Child to Parent Communication.
5. Stateful Components VS Stateless Components.
6. React State and Events.
7. Working with Event Handlers - Handling Events.
8. Adding the Form Input and Listening to User Input.
9.  Handling Form Submission.
10. Adding Two-Way Binding.
11. Controlled VS UnControlled Components.


<!-- Rules of Hook -->
1. Call Hooks at the top level of your component - not inside loops, conditions, nested functions.
2. Hooks are meant for Functional Components only.
3. All the Hooks starts with "use"
