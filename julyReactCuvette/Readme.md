3. Package.json
4. Installing and Updating Packages.

6. ==> Single Page Application.
7. ==> Virtual DOM - A Virtual DOM is a JavaScript-based, in-memory representation of the user interface's Document Object Model (DOM). Modern frameworks like React use the Virtual DOM to improve UI rendering performance by creating a "virtual" copy of the real DOM. When a component's state changes, the framework creates a new Virtual DOM, compares it to the previous one (a process called diffing), and then updates only the changed parts of the actual browser DOM, rather than repainting the entire page.
